# Disappearing Text Application

This repository contains a Python script for a GUI-based application where user-entered text will disappear after 5 seconds of inactivity. The application uses Tkinter for the graphical user interface, allowing users to start and stop the inactivity timer, view the remaining time, and enter text in a text area. The GUI has been styled with colors and better fonts for an enhanced user experience.
